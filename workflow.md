## ✅ **1. Overview & Objective**

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developing a robust, intuitive, and highly functional Three.js interactive asset editor. The editor will enable users (initially protected by a simple password) to perform the following:

- Upload `.glb` 3D assets through drag-and-drop.
- Precisely position, rotate, scale, and animate assets using keyframes.
- Adjust camera perspective dynamically.
- Save and seamlessly integrate the resulting animation directly onto an AI-generated landing page.

## 📚 **2. Detailed User Flow & Features**

### **2.1 Editor Interface**

- **Canvas Overlay:**  
  - **Transparent canvas** layered accurately over the AI-generated landing page UI.  
  - Clearly visible, instructive text: *"Drag & Drop your .glb files here or click to upload."*  
  - Allow multiple assets simultaneously for advanced composition.
- **Persistent Base UI:**  
  - A pixel-perfect replica of landing page UI beneath the editor canvas.
  - The editor's canvas is semi-transparent (~90% transparency) to maintain context.
-It can move with the asset together.
-Every time the user hit thekeyframe button, the system record the asset current position.
-The 3d asset and the canvas moving together if the user drag the asset down to reposition it. 
-This will be add the animated effect after the keyframe "record" is ready.

### **2.2 Asset Upload & Management**

- **Drag-and-Drop:**  
  - Users can drag `.glb` file directly onto the canvas.
  - Instant visual loading with clear loading feedback.
- **Asset Browser Panel:**  
  - Side panel listing all uploaded assets.
  - Ability to toggle visibility, rename, reposition, and delete assets.

### **2.3 Advanced Asset Controls & Transformations**

- **Transform Gizmo:**  
  - Interactive gizmo for precise transformations (translate, rotate, scale).
  - Visual axis guides (X, Y, Z axes highlighted clearly).
- **Precision Inputs:**  
  - Numerical inputs for all transformations (position, rotation, scale), allowing precision editing.

### **2.4 Keyframe & Timeline Editor**

- **Timeline Component:**  
  - Advanced, smooth, interactive timeline at bottom of page.
  - Clearly marked timestamps; intuitive UI similar to industry standards (Adobe After Effects, Blender).
- **Keyframe Management:**  
  - Record transformations (position, rotation, scale) at specific timestamps.
  - Visual indication of keyframe points.
  - Ability to drag keyframes to adjust timing effortlessly.
- **Playback & Scrubbing:**  
  - Instant playback preview, scrubbing through timeline to preview animations frame-by-frame.

### **2.5 Camera Control**

- **Dynamic Camera Interface:**  
  - Real-time adjustable camera position and rotation to enhance visual storytelling.
  - Camera positions can have their own keyframes for advanced cinematic effects.
- **Camera Presets:**  
  - Ability to save and reuse specific camera angles or animation paths.

### **2.6 Scroll-Driven Animation**

- **Scroll Interaction:**  
  - Animations linked to user's scroll action, enhancing interactivity.
  - Timeline synchronized with scroll events for immersive storytelling effect.

### **2.7 Saving & Publishing**

- **Save Button:**  
  - Clearly visible “Save & Implement” button.
  - Automatically exports animation data, camera settings, and asset references.
- **Instant Landing Page Implementation:**  
  - Saved animations instantly populate and activate on the main landing page.

## 🖥️ **3. Technical Stack & Implementation**

**Frontend Stack:**

- **UI Framework:** React.js (latest)  
- **3D Framework:** Three.js with React Three Fiber (R3F) integration  
- **State Management:** Zustand (Lightweight, performant, ideal for complex state)  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (fast prototyping, responsive) + Custom CSS  
- **Drag-and-Drop:** React Dropzone (robust, intuitive)  
- **Timeline Component:** Custom-built React component with GSAP for smooth animations and timeline scrubbing

  "projectId": "unique-project-id",
  "assets": [
    {
      "id": "asset-1",
      "url": "/assets/model.glb",
      "keyframes": [
        {
          "time": 0,
          "position": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
          "rotation": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
          "scale": {"x": 1, "y": 1, "z": 1}
        },

          "rotation": {"x": 0, "y": 1.57, "z": 0},
          "scale": {"x": 1.5, "y": 1.5, "z": 1.5}
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "cameraKeyframes": [
    {
      "time": 0,
      "position": {"x": 0, "y": 2, "z": 5},
